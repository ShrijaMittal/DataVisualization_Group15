Visualizations on World Happiness Index

World happiness index 
We are tracking the changes between 2015 and 2022 in the world happiness index, most importantly focusing on the impact of Covid on total score and the variables that make up the total score. We also check the importance of each variable’s effect on the total score by identifying the variables with higher correlation (GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, and Social Support) and do a deeper analysis to detect some outliers that go against the general trend, for example, by retaining high social support values even though their GDP per capita is not the greatest.
There are visualisations showing the countries that experience the highest change in total score and the region these countries are from, how regional averages have changed over time, how different variables change based on different regions, and how different variables are correlated with the total score calculated. 
To summarise sum of the findings that the visualisations are showing, the life expectancy of the 20 countries with the highest healthy life expectancy have decreased noticeably due to Covid which seems to be true of the rest of the world. Central and Eastern Europe had the highest mean happiness score increase as a region, and combined with Sub Saharan Africa dominated the top 20 risers in score. Sub Saharan Africa, interestingly, also got the lion’s share in top 20 fallers with 35%, hinting at polarisation between countries in the region. For the variables, it can be said that generosity seems to be noticeably less correlated with score than other variables, with GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy and social support being the most correlated. In GDP per capita, Western European and North American countries showed the least deviation among the countries in these regions when compared to countries of other regions.
